# Sonic 1 Universal Codebase

This is Sonic 1 with most of the bug fixes and QoL improvements outlined in Sonic Retro, alongside my own.
A bunch of bugs are patched and physics are changed, but here's the general idea.


Sonic has a new palette that's inbetween Sonic 1 and Sonic 2
Rings now have underwater physics, courtesy of redhotsonic.
The "Spike Bug" has been removed, due to the tutorial by FraGag
The speed caps have been removed, thanks to Tweaker and Puto
Many bug fixes.
